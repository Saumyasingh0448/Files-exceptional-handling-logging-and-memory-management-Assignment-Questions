        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line at runtime, making them slower but more flexible (e.g., Python, JavaScript). Compiled languages convert code into machine code before execution, making them faster but less flexible (e.g., C, C++).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors using try, except, finally, and raise blocks, preventing program crashes and ensuring smooth execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block in exception handling is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not, ensuring cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging in Python is a way to track events during program execution, helping in debugging and monitoring. It is implemented using the logging module to record messages at different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, helping in resource cleanup like closing files or releasing memory.\n",
        "\n",

        "-Multithreading: Uses multiple threads within the same process, sharing memory. It is suitable for I/O-bound tasks but limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space. It is ideal for CPU-bound tasks and bypasses the GIL, enabling true parallel execution.\n",

        "The basic steps involved in exception handling in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Try Block (try) – Wraps the code that may raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Except Block (except) – Catches and handles the specific exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Else Block (else) – Executes code if no exception occurs (optional).\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "-Memory management is important in Python because it ensures efficient use of system resources, prevents memory leaks, and improves program performance. Key reasons include:\n",

        "Garbage Collector (GC): Handles cyclic references using generational garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "-The else block in exception handling is used to execute code only if no exceptions occur in the try block. It helps separate error-handling code from normal execution.\n",
